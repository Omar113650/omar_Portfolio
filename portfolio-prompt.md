## 🟠 PROJECTS SECTION (Case Studies Style)

### ⭐ Project Presentation Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Each project MUST include:
1. **Large external image** (mockup/dashboard/abstract tech image)
2. Image appears **outside the card frame** or **partially overlapping** it
3. Premium, modern look with real product feel
4. Images match dark navy/purple theme
5. Slight glow or shadow around images

### Image Guidelines
- High-quality tech-related visuals:
  - SaaS dashboards
  - Admin panels
  - Booking systems
  - Dark UI mockups
  - Code architecture diagrams
- Images should feel like real products, not placeholders

### Layout Alternation
- **Project 1**: Image on left / text on right
- **Project 2**: Image on right / text on left
- Continue alternating pattern

### UI Behavior
- Images animate on scroll (fade-in / slide-up)
- Subtle hover effects (scale or glow)
- Smooth transitions

### Code & Technology Emphasis
- **All projects are backend-focused**
- Clearly state: "Built with Node.js (Express.js / NestJS)"
- Use tech stack icons/labels:
  - Node.js
  - NestJS
  - TypeScript
  - MongoDB / SQL Server
- Each project card includes:
  - "View Code" button (links to GitHub)
  - "Architecture Overview" button
  - Emphasis on: Clean architecture, Modular structure, Production-ready code
